# About the Cookbook

The Cookbook is a section that contains source code examples for accomplishing tasks that do not have straightforward solutions. The Cookbook is mainly for giving solutions for these problems and less about explaining _how_ the solution code actually solves the problem.

If you have some spare time, I do encourage you to try to pick apart the cookbook examples and try to understand _how_ they work. However, understanding how they work is not required in order to successfully integrate these snippets in your projects.

Feel free to use these code snippets in your games or personal projects! No, seriously, ++ctrl+c++ and ++ctrl+v++ are your best friend![^1]


[^1]: Copy and pasting code from sites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) is actually something professional programmers do fairly often. However, as a student, do be aware about your class's policy on copying and pasting code from the Internet. In addition, some open source code is published under specific licensing terms that might restrict how you can use their code. Keep these two points in consideration if you are copying and pasting!
