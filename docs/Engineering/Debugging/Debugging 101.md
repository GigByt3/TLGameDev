# Debugging 101

Bugs are an inevitable and unavoidable part of software engineering. This is mainly because programming is _really complicated_ and no one is perfect. Just take a minute to think about it; in order for a program to execute successfully, a million things need to function perfectly. Any single mistake - be it a logic error in your code, an unhandled runtime exception, or even a problem with the computer's hardware - can cause the program to crash. Honestly, it is amazing that anything works at all!

As a programmer, it is likely that you will **spend more time debugging than writing code.** So, it's important to learn not just how to code, but how to debug effectively.
